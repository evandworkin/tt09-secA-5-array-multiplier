## How it works

This project takes in two 4-bit inputs and multiplies them together into a an 8-bit output. It uses an array of 12 full adders to do so (see image)

## How to test

Input two 4-bit numbers via ui_in. The 4 most significant bits are taken to be the first term, the 4 least significant bits are taken to be the second term. The 8 uo_out bits are the output, in binary.

## External hardware

None
